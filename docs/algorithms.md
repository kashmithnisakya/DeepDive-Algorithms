## Algorithms Overview

### 1. **Algorithms in Data Structures**

#### **Sorting Algorithms**
- **QuickSort**: 
  - **Concept**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' and partitions the array into smaller and larger subarrays. It recursively sorts the subarrays.
  - **Time Complexity**: 
    - Average: $$O(n \log n)$$
    - Worst: $$O(n^2)$$ (when poor pivot choices are made)
  - **Space Complexity**: $$O(\log n)$$ due to recursion.
  - **Use Case**: Efficient for large datasets, especially when average case performance is prioritized over worst-case.

- **MergeSort**:

  - **Time Complexity**: $$O(n \log n)$$ (even in the worst case).
  - **Space Complexity**: $$O(n)$$ (requires additional space for merging).
  - **Use Case**: Preferred for large datasets where stable sorting (preserving order of equal elements) is required.
